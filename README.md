First I started by getting our csv's and merging the data. 
Then, I got the mice count, checked our duplicated data and cleaned our DataFrame. 
To corroborate I did it correctly I made the count of mice again. 
After that I proceeded to get the statistics requested for the Tumor Volume. 
To continue, I made bar charts to compare the Observed Timepoints for the different drugs tested. 
After that, I made a pie chart to show the gender of mice. 
Then the data was processed to get the data at the greates Timepoint. 
Then, 4 drugs were selected to make the box plots to show the Tumor Volume Outliers. 
A mouse was selected to observe the tumor volume vs timepoint with the drug Capomulin. 
Next, the average of the Tumor volume was evaluated against the weight. 
With this observation, the correlation was calculated and a linear regression was made.
